<p><strong>COOKIES/IMAGE TAGS</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don&rsquo;t have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, and for other purposes.</p>
<p>The use of cookies is an industry standard and they are currently used on most websites, including this Site. Cookies are a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of a user&rsquo;s computer so that the website administrator or a third party operational service provider may identify the computer and passively track the user&rsquo;s activities on the website. Image tags work in conjunction with cookies and are small image files that may be located on select pages of our Site, or with-in web-based email newsletters that we may send. (Image tags are also called web beacons, web bugs, clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs.) Tracking is important because we can better understand what parts of our website are used the most, when to launch new services and how to enhance current offerings. We may share the information we receive from cookies and image tags with third-parties and our advertisers in aggregate form, which means that such information does not contain specific personal information about any one visitor.</p>
<p>In short, cookies and image tags collect a user&rsquo;s Internet protocols and server information. Such data files allow our Site to remember your web browser when you visit our Site and are necessary tools for quick and efficient access to the Site. A cookie will not allow the Site to learn any personal information (such as your real name and email address) that you have not otherwise disclosed. Cookies and image tags allow the Site to remember important information that will make the Site easier for you to use and helpful in our administration of various activities. We do not use cookies or image tags to collect other personal information unless you give us permission to do so.</p>
<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie or image tag is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all such devices. This is done through your browser. If you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features at our Site that make your Internet experience more efficient and enjoyable - like the features mentioned above - and some of our other services will not function properly.</p>

<p>This Site often provides links to third party websites that could be of interest to our users, including the websites of our advertisers. We do not own or control these websites and therefore, we are not responsible for the content, business practices, nor operations of such websites. Third party websites linked on this Site may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do. The presence of a link to a third party website does not constitute or imply our endorsement, recommendation, or sponsorship of the third party content, goods, or services available through, or contained on, the Site.
